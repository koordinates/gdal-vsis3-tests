This repository contains a small `pytest` unit test suite that I'm using to call GDAL functions using the `/vsis3/` file system driver.

To use the test suite, you need Python 2, `pytest`, a trunk version of GDAL and `python-gdal`.

You need to set your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.
